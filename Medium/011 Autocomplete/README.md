Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Twitter.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.

Stopped because there were too many obscure bugs and it was using too much time.
Figured it would be better to solve a different problem than continue hunting down bugs

If I were to continue working on it, would replace HashSet with ArrayList and start from there
