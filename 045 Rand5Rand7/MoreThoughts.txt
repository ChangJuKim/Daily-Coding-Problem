How to make it extensible?

Lets use rand5() and rand7() as examples

Idea 1:
  1. Determine smallest x so that 5^x > 7 [x is 2 in this specific example]
  2. Call rand5() x times
  3. On the xth call, multiply rand5() by 5^(x-1).
  4. If it's the last couple of results, repeat 2-3. Otherwise return sum mod 7.
